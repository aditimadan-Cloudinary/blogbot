## Build a personal blog assistant with IBM and Cloudinary
What's the easiest way to upload relevant pictures for your blog posts?
Pass the blog through IBM NLP to let it extract the relevant data! For an efficient, automated way to get the images for your blog, create an account on Cloudinary and upload images that visually underscore the content of your blog. Cloudinary will then take care of auto-tagging each of your images during the upload to keep track of the content.
Next, the data from the blog will be passed to Cloudinary to find the most relevant images -- and voila! You will have the images for your blog post. You can even take it a step further by specifying the dimensions and effects you'd like to apply to your images.

A typical online conversation between you and the bot might go like this...

User: Bot, can you look for pictures for my blog?

Bot: Please give me a URL!

User: medium.com/url

Bot: Here are five pictures based on the content of your blog.

User: Great, can you reduce the size to 100x100?

Bot: Sure, you can get your pictures from

User: What effects can you put on these pictures?

Bot: I can increase shadows, highlights, or make the picture black and white. What would you like me to do?

User: Make the picture black and white.

Bot: Great, you can get the updated pictures .
